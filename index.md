Just some little single-page tools to hopefully keep me sharp on development techniques, as well as scratch itches.

## The Pages

[Simple Timezone Converter](simpletimezone/)
:A simpler timezone converter than I could find at the time; simply input the timezone and start time of your meeting, and the start time in your timezone is shown.

[Hex Conversion Tester](hexconv/)
:Assess your conversion between hex, binary and decimal.

[Colour Page](colourpage/)
:Type in a hex number and the page's background is set to the corresponding colour.

A collection of single-page tools to scratch itches and help me learn accessible development techniques.

## Updated

[HTML Attribute Filter](html-attribute-filter/)
: Helps tidy up code excerpts from sites, to be used as examples when writing reports.

[Four Lights](four-lights/)
: Simulator of part of the [Lixie](https://www.tindie.com/products/connornishijima/lixie-an-led-alternative-to-the-nixie-tube/) Arduino libraries to prototype colour changes before coding for the device.

## Stable

[Tweet Drafter](tweetdrafter/)
: Draft your tweets with nice big text and without the risk of premature sending. *(Needs to be updated to reflect changed character limits.)*

[Colour Page](colourpage/)

: Assess your conversion between hex, binary and decimal.

[twitipedia](twitipedia/)

## Attic

[Commit Line](commitline/)

[Simple Timezone Converter](simpletimezone/)
